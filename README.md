# 🏠 Room-Based Smart Attendance System  

## 📌 Project Overview  

The **Room-Based Smart Attendance System** is a mobile-based solution designed to simplify hostel attendance marking using **facial recognition**. Unlike conventional biometric systems, this system allows students to mark attendance **directly from their rooms**, ensuring convenience, reducing congestion, and improving hostel management efficiency.  

---

## 🎯 Features  

### **1. Student Module**  
✅ **Face-Based Attendance** – Students mark attendance using facial recognition.  
✅ **Mobile Authentication** – No need for physical biometric scanners.  
✅ **Time-Stamped Records** – Ensures accurate attendance logging.  
✅ **Automated Notifications** – Alerts students who miss attendance windows.  

### **2. Admin Module**  
✅ **Face Registration** – Authorities register students’ faces during onboarding.  
✅ **Attendance Monitoring** – View and manage student attendance records.  
✅ **Real-Time Insights** – Check live attendance reports.

## 🎯 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Students Login** via the mobile app.  
2️⃣ **Face Recognition** authenticates identity.  
3️⃣ **Attendance is recorded** with a timestamp.  
4️⃣ **Admins can view reports** and send alerts if needed.
